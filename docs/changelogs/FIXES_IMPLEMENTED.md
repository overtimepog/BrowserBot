# BrowserBot Fixes Implemented

## Issues Identified

1. **Wrong Selector for Hacker News**: The AI was using `h2.titleline > a` instead of `.titleline`
2. **Not Using Multiple Element Extraction**: The AI wasn't using `extract_type="text_all"` for extracting multiple items
3. **AI Hallucinating Data**: When extraction failed or returned limited data, the AI was making up fake story titles
4. **Duplicate Data in Results**: The AI response showed repeated story titles (stories 2&3 and 4&5 were identical)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Mistral Prompt (src/browserbot/agents/mistral_tool_executor.py)

Added clearer instructions and examples:
- Emphasized using `extract_type="text_all"` for multiple items
- Added explicit rule: "NEVER make up or hallucinate data"
- Corrected Hacker News selectors with specific examples
- Added warning about not using `h2.titleline > a`

### 2. Improved Tool Result Handling

Added special handling for extraction results:
- When extraction succeeds with data: Emphasizes using ONLY the extracted data
- When extraction returns empty: Instructs to try different selector or report no data found
- When extraction fails: Instructs to report the issue instead of making up data

### 3. Better Examples in Prompt

```json
// Correct example for Hacker News:
{
  "name": "extract",
  "arguments": {
    "selector": ".titleline",
    "extract_type": "text_all"
  }
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Navigate to Hacker News**: The AI correctly navigates to the site
2. **Wait for Page Load**: Ensures the page is fully loaded
3. **Extract Story Titles**: Uses `.titleline` selector with `extract_type="text_all"`
4. **Return Actual Data**: Only returns the real extracted story titles, no hallucinations

## Testing

Run the test to verify:
```bash
./run.sh task "Go to news.ycombinator.com and summarize the top 5 stories"
```

Expected behavior:
- Should extract all story titles (typically 30 on the front page)
- Should show only the first 5 as requested
- Should NOT show duplicate or made-up titles

## Future Improvements

### Tab/Page Reuse (Not Implemented Yet)
While the current architecture creates new pages for each task (for security/isolation), a tab pooling system could be added:

1. **Warm Tabs Pool**: Similar to warm browsers, maintain pre-created tabs
2. **Tab Reuse**: For same-domain navigation, reuse existing tabs
3. **Security Boundaries**: Only reuse tabs within same security context
4. **Performance**: Reduce page creation overhead for repeated tasks

### Implementation Ideas:
```python
class TabPool:
    def __init__(self, max_tabs_per_domain=5):
        self.domain_tabs = {}  # domain -> [tabs]
    
    async def get_tab(self, url):
        domain = extract_domain(url)
        if domain in self.domain_tabs and self.domain_tabs[domain]:
            return self.domain_tabs[domain].pop(0)
        return None
```

This would significantly improve performance for tasks that repeatedly visit the same site.
