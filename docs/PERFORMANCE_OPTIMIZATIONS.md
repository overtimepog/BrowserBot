# BrowserBot Performance Optimizations

This document describes the performance optimizations implemented to speed up BrowserBot operations, particularly for complex tasks like scraping news sites.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Redis Caching System
- **Screenshot Caching**: Screenshots are cached for 5 minutes to avoid retaking identical screenshots
- **DOM Snapshot Caching**: DOM stability states are cached for 30 seconds
- **AI Response Caching**: LLM responses are cached for 2 hours for similar queries
- **Extraction Result Caching**: Data extraction results are cached for 10 minutes

### 2. Browser Pool Optimization
- **Warm Browser Instances**: Maintains 2 pre-warmed browser instances ready for immediate use
- **Browser Reuse**: Intelligently reuses existing browser contexts instead of creating new ones
- **Increased Pool Size**: Maximum concurrent browsers increased from 5 to 8
- **Smart Context Selection**: Chooses browser instance with fewest active contexts

### 3. Reduced Delays
- **Human-like Delays**: Reduced by 70-80% when optimization is enabled
- **DOM Stability Wait**: Reduced from 0.5s to 0.15s with caching
- **Typing Speed**: Increased 3-5x when optimization is enabled
- **Minimal Action Delays**: Only 30ms between actions in optimized mode

### 4. Parallel Processing
- **Concurrent Browser Operations**: Multiple browser contexts can run simultaneously
- **Async Operations**: All browser and AI operations are fully async
- **Background Tasks**: Cleanup and warmup run in background threads

### 5. Configuration Changes
- **Retry Delay**: Reduced from 1.0s to 0.5s
- **Memory Allocation**: 4GB for Docker container with 2GB shared memory
- **Cache-first Architecture**: Checks cache before expensive operations

## Usage

### Enable All Optimizations (Default)
```bash
./run.sh exec "Go to news.ycombinator.com and summarize the top 5 stories"
```

### Disable Caching (for Testing)
```bash
./run.sh exec "Your task here" --no-cache
```

### Monitor Performance
The browser manager logs cache hit rates and performance metrics:
- Cache hit rate displayed in logs
- Browser pool status shown every 30 seconds
- Performance metrics available at http://localhost:8000

## Performance Improvements

Expected improvements for complex tasks:
- **First Run**: Normal speed (building caches)
- **Subsequent Runs**: 2-5x faster due to caching
- **Screenshot-heavy Tasks**: 3-10x faster with screenshot caching
- **Similar Queries**: Near-instant with AI response caching
- **Navigation**: 30-50% faster with reduced delays

## Architecture

### Cache Keys
- Screenshots: `browserbot:screenshot:{url_hash}:{selector}`
- DOM State: `browserbot:dom:{url_hash}`
- AI Responses: `browserbot:ai_response:{model}:{prompt_hash}`
- Extractions: `browserbot:extraction:{url_hash}:{extraction_key}`

### Cache TTLs
- Screenshots: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- DOM State: 30 seconds
- AI Responses: 7200 seconds (2 hours)
- Extraction Results: 600 seconds (10 minutes)

## Monitoring

### Redis Cache Stats
Connect to Redis to monitor cache usage:
```bash
docker exec -it browserbot-redis redis-cli
AUTH browserbot123
INFO stats
```

## Future Optimizations

Potential future improvements:
1. **Request Deduplication**: Batch similar requests
2. **Predictive Caching**: Pre-cache likely next actions
3. **Distributed Caching**: Share cache across multiple instances
4. **Smart Cache Invalidation**: Detect when cached data is stale
5. **Browser State Serialization**: Save and restore browser state
